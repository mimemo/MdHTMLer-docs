## Features
- Convert Markdown to HTML
- Convert whole folder
- Table of contents can be added. (Optional)


## Background: 
There are many ways to convert a single Markdown. However, applications that convert entire folders are not very common.

I thought it would be useful to be able to convert a whole folder, so I made this.

## Usage: 
1. prepare a folder containing markdown files
2. specify the folder you prepared in 1.
3. specify the destination folder
4. click the Export button
5. If all goes well, you will have an HTML file in the destination folder.
